    ### 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

    Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common
    subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

    A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
    with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order
    of the remaining characters.

    For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
    A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both
    strings.

    **Example 1:**
    > Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

    ### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

    Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly
    increasing subsequence.

    **Example 1:**
    > Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore
    the length is 4.

    ### 72. Edit Distance

    Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations
    required to convert word1 to word2.

    You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
    * Insert a character
    * Delete a character
    * Replace a character


    **Example 1:**
    > Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    * horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    * rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    * rose -> ros (remove 'e')
