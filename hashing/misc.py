    ### 49. Group Anagrams

    Given an array of strings strs, group the together. You can return the answer
    in any order.

    **Example 1:**
    > Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
    Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
    Explanation:
    * There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
    * The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form
    each other.
    * The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged
    to form each other.
